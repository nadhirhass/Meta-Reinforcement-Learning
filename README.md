# Meta-Reinforcement-Learning
Recently Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems have shown a huge improvement in terms of per- formance in a different domains. However the major limitation is the need of massive training data. Previous works have shown that deep reinforcement learning(deep RL) methods could adapt rapidly to new tasks and even better results when using Black box approach such as Deep Neural network in a meta-learning setting. Even this method tend to be very flexible but could be data inefficient. Some authors have suggested an optimization based approach where the meta-parameters are obtained through optimization. In this paper we will discuss both methods in a meta reinforcement learning context.
